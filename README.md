This project integrates drone-based SLAM technology with a mobile IoT application for real-time environmental monitoring. It captures key parameters like COâ‚‚, AQI, temperature, pressure, and humidity, along with geo-location using an LTE module. The system is designed for accurate mapping and data visualization of environmental conditions.
